Overview

This dataset focuses on analyzing the energy efficiency of residential buildings by examining how different architectural and design features affect heating and cooling energy loads.
It is widely used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression-based machine learning models.

The dataset contains only numerical variables and is clean, with no missing values, making it suitable for direct analysis and predictive modeling.

 Dataset Description

The data represents simulated building designs with varying shapes, sizes, and glazing characteristics.
Each record corresponds to a building configuration, while the features describe physical properties of the building.

The target variables are:

Heating_Load: Energy required for heating

Cooling_Load: Energy required for cooling
